## Description

We decided to do the simple SMTP email sending program using Java. We set it up to send from `gschmi4@uic.edu` to `phorwi2@uic.edu`. We consolidated the parameters at the top as variables to make it easier to extend this to a more general application where the user provides those details.

## Usage

```
$ javac EmailSender.java
$ java EmailSender
```
